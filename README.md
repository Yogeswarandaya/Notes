A simple note application where each user can have their own section-wise categorized notes.

User has to register their account with the application. Once the registration is complete and successful, 
user can login to the application to create notes and these notes can be grouped under a feature called Section. A user can perform 
create, update, delete operations on the created notes. A user can have access only to those notes that they have created.
